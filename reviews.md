> "We had our entire house carpeted by John, he was thoroughly professional throughout the process, made sure we were happy with the carpet we picked and suggested we buy a slightly higher quality carpet that came with a 10 year warranty. His installers were AWESOME and were very quick and courteous. We had some creaks in our floor boards and they also fixed them all. John personally supervised the entire installation and got it done ahead of schedule as we were in a time crunch. I have finally found a good contractor for all my flooring needs and would highly recommend anyone that needs flooring done." **- Sajid V.**

> "I went to Atlas based on the great Yelp reviews. We had 2 bedrooms, a hallway and our stairs re-carpeted. John came to our house the same day we went in to look at carpet swatches and pick out carpet color's. John came to our house after hours, the same day and then wrote up the quote. He really went out of his way to make our order get going as quickly as possible. The crew who installed the carpets were Really nice and cleaned up very well, after they were done. The carpets look Amazing!!!!! The quality of the instillation is Excellent!!!!! We will definitely use them in the future and will recommend them as well!!!" **- Toni F.**

> "Atlas just replaced all the carpet in our home and it looks great! We stopped by the store to look at samples and John came out the same day to give us an estimate. He called the carpet suppliers in Dalton, GA, from our home to see if the options we liked were in stock and put a hold on 2 or 3 different carpets. We also got estimates from other carpet companies but John's attitude was what sold us. I wanted the carpet installed ASAP and he was able to get it quickly and arrange installation immediately. Because of his prices, we upgraded to a higher quality carpet (25 year warranty) for about the same as the other companies charge for a 10 year warranty. Atlas is highly recommended!" **- C.E.**

> "John is the kindest and most polite man in business. When he tells you not to worry he means it. His prices and service are excellent. Always follows up and returns phone calls. Highly recommended. Will never go anywhere else very professional job." **- Lynne M.**
