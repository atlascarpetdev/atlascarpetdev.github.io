Established in 1980.

Atlas Discount Carpet, Inc. is a family-run business that first opened in Torrance, but has since moved to its current location on Pacific Coast Highway in Lomita. We have been in business for nearly 40 years and have been committed to serving the South Bay with the lowest prices and best quality available.

After earning his engineering degree, John opened Atlas Discount Carpet 40 years ago due to his love for home and flooring design. His attention to detail and his long experience in the floor covering industry is what keeps his customers coming back and referring their friends and family to Atlas Discount Carpet.

Since we are a family-owned business, we work with you on an individual one-on-one basis in order to ensure that you find the flooring you are looking for at the right price.

Experience is important in the flooring industry, and we have decades of experience you can trust!
